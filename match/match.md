# Pattern matching examples

Generated from test cases.


## 1. Simple matching example


A very basic test that shows how a pattern variable (`?likes`) gets bound during matching.
The pattern
```JSON
{"likes":"?likes"}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"likes":"tacos"}

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?likes":"tacos"}]

```

## 2. Variable with constant


A map with a variable and a constant.
The pattern
```JSON
{"likes":"?likes","when":"now"}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"likes":"tacos","when":"now"}

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?likes":"tacos"}]

```

## 4. Two constants


A map with two constants.
The pattern
```JSON
{"likes":"queso","when":"now"}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"likes":"queso","when":"now"}

```

should return
```JSON
[{}]

```

## 6. Multiple variables


This simple example shows bindings for two pattern variables.
The pattern
```JSON
{"likes":"?likes","wants":"?wants"}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"likes":"tacos","wants":"queso"}

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?likes":"tacos","?wants":"queso"}]

```

## 7. Deeper variable


Pattern matching is fully structured
The pattern
```JSON
{"needs":{"tacos":{"n":"?n"}}}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"needs":{"tacos":{"n":2}}}

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?n":2}]

```

## 8. Same variable twice (good)


If you use a pattern variable more than once, then the bindings must agree.  See the next example.
The pattern
```JSON
{"n":"?n","needs":{"tacos":{"n":"?n"}}}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"n":2,"needs":{"tacos":{"n":2}}}

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?n":2}]

```

## 9. Same variable twice (bad)


If you use a pattern variable more than once, then the bindings must agree.  See the previous example.
The pattern
```JSON
{"n":"?n","needs":{"tacos":{"n":"?n"}}}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"n":3,"needs":{"tacos":{"n":2}}}

```

should return
```JSON
[]

```

## 10. Array as a set


An array is treated as a set.
The pattern
```JSON
{"a":["?a"],"is":"?a"}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"a":[1,2,3,4],"is":3}

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?a":3}]

```

## 11. Array with a variable and a constant


An array is treated as a set; multiple bindings possible.
The pattern
```JSON
["a","?x"]

```

matched against
```JSON
["a","b","c"]

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?x":"b"},{"?x":"c"}]

```

## 12. Array with a variable and a map constant

The pattern
```JSON
[{"likes":"tacos"},"?x"]

```

matched against
```JSON
[{"likes":"tacos"},"b","c"]

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?x":"b"},{"?x":"c"}]

```

## 13. Array with a variable and a constant; message with map elements

The pattern
```JSON
["a","b","?x"]

```

matched against
```JSON
[{"likes":"tacos"},"b","a"]

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?x":{"likes":"tacos"}}]

```

## 14. Array with a map containing a variable

The pattern
```JSON
["a","b",{"likes":"?x"}]

```

matched against
```JSON
[{"likes":"tacos"},{"likes":"chips"},"b","a"]

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?x":"tacos"},{"?x":"chips"}]

```

## 15. Array as a set; multiple bss; backtracking


An array is treated as a set.
The pattern
```JSON
{"a":["?a"],"is":["?a"]}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"a":[1,2,3,4],"is":[2,3]}

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?a":2},{"?a":3}]

```

## 16. Bad array vars


Two pattern variables inside an array isn't allowed (because the computational complexity means that some input could be very costly to process).
The pattern
```JSON
{"a":["?x","?y"]}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"a":[1]}

```

should return an error.

## 18. Property variable vars


You can have _at most one_ pattern variable as a key in a given map.
The pattern
```JSON
{"?x":1}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"n":1}

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?x":"n"}]

```

## 19. Multiple property variable vars


You can have _at most one_ pattern variable as a key in a given map.
The pattern
```JSON
{"?x":1,"?y":2}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"m":2,"n":1}

```

should return an error.

## 20. A null value

The pattern
```JSON
{"wants":"?wants"}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"needs":null,"wants":"tacos"}

```

should return
```JSON
[{"?wants":"tacos"}]

```

## 21. Type conflict: int/string

The pattern
```JSON
{"wants":1}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"wants":"one"}

```

should return
```JSON
[]

```

## 22. Type conflict: int/bool

The pattern
```JSON
{"wants":1}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"wants":true}

```

```JSON
[]

```

## 23. Anonymous variable used twice

The pattern
```JSON
{"count":"?","wants":"?"}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"count":48,"wants":"tacos"}

```

```JSON
[{}]

```

## 24. Anonymous variable with normal variable

The pattern
```JSON
{"count":"?","wants":"?","when":"?when"}

```

matched against
```JSON
{"count":48,"wants":"tacos","when":"today"}

```JSON
[{"?when":"today"}]

```

## 25. Anonymous variable as a property variable
