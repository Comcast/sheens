|KING LEAR|How now! what art thou?|
|||
|SHEEN|A machine, sir.|
|||
|KING LEAR|What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?|
|||
|SHEEN|I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve<br>him truly that will put me in trust: to love him<br>that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,<br>and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I<br>cannot choose; and to eat no fish.|
|||
|KING LEAR|What art thou?|
|||
|SHEEN|A very honest-hearted machine, and as poor as the king.|
|||
|KING LEAR|If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a<br>king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?|
|||
|SHEEN|Service.|
|||
|KING LEAR|Who wouldst thou serve?|
|||
|SHEEN|You.|
|||
|KING LEAR|Dost thou know me, fellow?|
|||
|SHEEN|No, sir; but you have that in your countenance<br>which I would fain call master.|
|||
|KING LEAR|What's that?|
|||
|SHEEN|Authority.|
|||
|KING LEAR|What services canst thou do?|
|||
|SHEEN|I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious<br>tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message<br>bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am<br>qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.|
