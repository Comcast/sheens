# Crew that talks to an MQTT broker

Doesn't (yet) provide any persistence.

Also see the MQTT command-line client [`mqclient`](../mqclient).

## Usage

For an example session, see `run.sh`, which expects an insecure MQTT
broker on 1883.  (See the _insecure_
[`mosquitto.conf`](mosquitto.conf) to use with `mosquitto -c
mosquitto.conf`.)
